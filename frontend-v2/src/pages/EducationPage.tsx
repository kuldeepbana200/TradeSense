            Imagine two boats tied together with a rope floating on the ocean.
            When waves push them apart, the rope eventually pulls them back
            together. Statistical arbitrage (stat-arb) finds pairs of assets
            that behave like those boats — they tend to move together over time.

            term="Cointegration"
            plain="Two assets that always drift back toward each other over the long run, even if they wander in the short term. Like two friends who always meet for dinner eventually, no matter how far apart they roam during the day."
            technical="Two I(1) time series are cointegrated if a linear combination produces a stationary I(0) series. Tested via Engle-Granger or Johansen tests."
          />
          <ConceptCard
            term="Z-Score"
            plain="A number that tells you how unusual the current spread is compared to history. A z-score of 2.0 means the spread is wider than 97.7% of all historical observations — very unusual."
            technical="z = (spread − μ) / σ, where μ and σ are the rolling mean and standard deviation of the spread. Trade signals typically use |z| > 1.5–2."
          />
          <ConceptCard
            term="Hedge Ratio"
            plain="The exact ratio of how much money to put on each asset so the trade is balanced. If you put $1 on Asset A, the hedge ratio tells you exactly how much to put on Asset B."
            technical="β from OLS regression: Y = α + βX + ε. For every unit of X held long, β units of Y are held short. Ensures the position is market-neutral."
          />
          <ConceptCard
            term="Half-Life"
            plain="How long, on average, it takes for a spread to close halfway to the mean after it opens. A half-life of 7 days means your money is typically tied up for about 1–2 weeks."
            technical="Derived from the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reversion model: Δspread_t = λ·spread_{t-1} + ε_t. Half-life = −ln(2) / ln(1 + λ)."
          />
          <ConceptCard
            term="Spread"
            plain="The gap between where the price ratio is now and where it normally sits. Think of it as the distance the boats have drifted apart before the rope pulls them back."
            technical="spread_t = Y_t − (α + β·X_t). The residual from the cointegrating regression. Normalized to z-score for interpretability."
          />
          <ConceptCard
            term="Mean Reversion"
            plain="The tendency for extreme values to return to normal over time. Like a rubber band: the more it stretches, the harder it snaps back."
            technical="Quantified by the speed-of-adjustment parameter λ in the error-correction model. Faster λ ≈ shorter half-life ≈ quicker opportunities."
          />
          <ConceptCard
            term="P-Value"
            plain="A measure of how confident we are that the pattern we see isn't just random luck. We want p-values below 0.05 — meaning there's less than a 5% chance the cointegration is a coincidence."
            technical="From the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test on the regression residuals. Lower p-value = stronger evidence of cointegration."

            finding="Broad survey of pairs strategies across different markets and time periods. Confirmed profitability in most regimes but noted declining returns in recent years as the strategy became more popular. Better results emerged from cointegration-based approaches vs. distance methods."

          works best with careful pair selection (cointegration over simple
          correlation), disciplined position sizing, and fast execution. Returns
          have compressed in mature markets — edge comes from finding pairs
          others miss (less-covered assets, cross-sector pairs, international
